## 📌 Project Overview

**Authentication-System** is an **industry-level, secure authentication system** built to demonstrate best practices for modern web authentication and authorization.

This repository also serves as a **documentation-style project**, explaining how to design, implement, and secure a **JWT-based authentication system** step by step.

Alongside authentication, the project experiments with **GSAP animations in Next.js** to improve UI/UX while maintaining performance and security.

## 📚 Documentation Purpose

This project is designed as a **learning-focused documentation website**, covering:

* How JWT authentication works
* Secure login & registration flows
* Role & permission handling
* Email & OTP verification logic
* Token storage strategies
* Frontend–backend communication
* UI animation integration without breaking SSR

Each section explains **why** a technique is used, not just **how**.

## 🎨 GSAP Integration

GSAP is used experimentally to:

* Improve page transitions
* Animate form feedback
* Enhance dashboard UI interactions
* Maintain smooth animations in **Next.js App Router**
